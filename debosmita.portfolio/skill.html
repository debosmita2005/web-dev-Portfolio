        <h2><u>HTML</u></h2>
        <P>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. It structures the content on the web, enabling the creation of visually engaging and user-friendly websites. From text and images to links and forms, HTML provides the essential framework that brings web pages to life.
            With HTML, I craft the skeleton of every webpage, ensuring that content is organized and accessible. My expertise in HTML allows me to build clean, semantic code that serves as the foundation for seamless user experiences, enhanced by CSS and JavaScript.</P>

        <h2><u>CSS</u></h2>
        <P>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that adds style and visual appeal to web pages. While HTML provides the structure, CSS breathes life into it by controlling layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics. With CSS, I transform basic HTML into polished, responsive designs that look great on any device.
            My proficiency in CSS enables me to create visually striking websites, whether it's a minimalist design or a complex layout. By leveraging modern CSS techniques, I ensure that every website I develop is not only beautiful but also consistent and user-friendly.</P>

        <h2><u>JavaScript</u></h2>
        <p>JavaScript is the programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites. While HTML structures the content and CSS styles it, JavaScript adds life, enabling features like animations, form validation, and real-time updates.
            With JavaScript, I create engaging user experiences that respond to user actions and adapt in real-time. Whether it's building complex web applications, enhancing UI/UX with interactive elements, or optimizing performance, my expertise in JavaScript allows me to develop websites that are not only functional but also intuitive and responsive.</p>
